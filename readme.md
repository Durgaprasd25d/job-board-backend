- MongoDB
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Durgaprasd25d/job-board-backend.git

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://yourMongoDBConnectionURI
   JWT_SECRET=yourJWTSecret
   EMAIL=yourEmailAddress
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=yourEmailPassword
   ```

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
